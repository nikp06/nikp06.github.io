I'm a freelance **AI & Machine Learning Engineer** based in **Cologne, Germany**, with a specialization in **multimodal AI Agents**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Generative AI (GenAI)** / **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and **Computer Vision**.

Using modern **MLOps/DevOps** practices and a solid understanding of **cloud technologies** and **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, I develop powerful, scalable, and maintainable end-to-end solutions.

### Here's what I do

I strive to collaborate on innovative cloud projects requiring solutions for NLP, LLMs, and Computer Vision challenges.

To achieve my goals I ...
- Develop and deploy models with a focus on scalability and performance.
- Create end-to-end AI pipelines, from data preprocessing to deployment, including monitoring and dashboarding.
- Provide collaborative support to help teams integrate machine learning solutions into their workflows.
