## Welcome to my personal blog!

My name is Niklas and I am a machine learning engineer and self-taught programmer. I have a masters degree in Human Technology in Sports and Medicine, but I soon found that using programming and software to solve problems in various fields of life to be even more in line with what I wanted to focus on and do in my working life.

### My Interest in Programming

I have always been fascinated with the potential of programming and AI to solve complex problems and make our lives easier. So I began to teach myself how to code and started building personal projects driven by my curiosity. These projects include writing and training AI systems that are capable of playing games (Icy Tower, Subway Surfers).

Actually being able to transfer knowledge to personal ideas and projects really sparked my initial interest to progress in this field. Putting the stuff that I have built out there on GitHub, Reddit and YouTube resulted in getting helpful feedback and reckognition from the community, which was a big motivator for me as well.

The fact that I am so curious and passionate about programming to take various computer science courses, start part-time jobs that involve programming and build and document personal coding projects in my spare time, all while studying for a masters degree is what eventually helped me to land a job in machine learning, I think.

### What to Expect
Now, I am more than happy to write code for a living and I want to use this website to (more or less randomly) document what I stumble across and learn along the way.

I created this blog mainly for myself as a way of documenting knowledge as I tackle various programming challenges. However, if it can help anyone else along the way, that would be even better.

On this blog, I will be sharing my journey as I continue to learn and grow as a programmer.
You can expect posts about:
- Solving interesting problems with Python and Golang
- Basic machine learning concepts
- DevOps
- Simple tips and tricks that make my life as a developer easier

I hope my experiences and insights can be beneficial to you and thank you for joining me on this journey.
