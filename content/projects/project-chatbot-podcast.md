description = "In collaboration with a well-known german history podcast, I developed a chatbot that was capable of leveraging the knowledge from nearly 500 episodes. To this end, a machine learning pipeline was deployed to the cloud to automatically transcribe podcast episodes and organize the contents in a vector database. Using a RAG agent and a large language model (LLM) the system provided precise answers to detailed questions and could even pinpoint, who was speaking, when he was speaking and in which episode. Moreover, a dashboard featured useful statistics such as speaking time analysis and word clouds."
