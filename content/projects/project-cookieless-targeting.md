The goal of this project was to further develop the department's product, which offers targeting on websites based on context and independently of third-party cookies. Key aspects included developing pipelines for data preparation, processing, and training, as well as providing inference endpoints for machine learning models in the cloud. Additionally, a web application was developed to simplify the future configuration of contextual customer segments. This application helps the department understand the underlying mechanisms of the source code through interactive tools and illustrates the impact of various configurations in an informative and visual manner.
