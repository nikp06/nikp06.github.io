description = "Development of a product for contextual - and 3rd-party cookie independent - targeting on websites. My task was to build data preparation, processing and training pipelines, as well as deploy inference endpoints for their machine learning models in the cloud. Additionally, a web application was developed to simplify the creation of new contextual customer segments by providing interactive tools to foresee effects of different configurations, ultimately leading to a better understanding of the inner workings of the underlying machine learning models."
