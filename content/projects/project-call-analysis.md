The goal was to better understand customer needs and satisfaction based on what they were reporting, when they were calling the companies' service hotline. To this end, transformers and LLMs, speech-to-text models and natural language processing techniques were used. Finally an end-to-end ML-Pipeline was deployed, delivering new and valuable insights into their customer's need on a daily basis."
