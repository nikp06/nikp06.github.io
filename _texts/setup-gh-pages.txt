# i ran into several issues trying to get jekyll to serve my static site that i want hosted with github pages -- heres how i solved it:

first of all you want the latest version of ruby installed
- check with ruby -v if you have it installed

if not install brew from terminal
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

then do
brew install ruby

check your ruby version and see if its the latest
ruby -v

make a test ruby command
ruby -e "puts 'Hello World'"

maybe: xcode-select --install ???

then install bundler and jekyll with gem:
gem install bundler jekyll

from a folder where you want your repository to live:
git clone your (empty) github repo nikp06/nikp06.github.io
cd nikp06/nikp06.github.io

initiate jekyll:
jekyll new .

open and edit Gemfile:
comment jekyll line
uncomment github-pages line

bundle update github-pages

bundle update

if bundle update fails:
rm Gemfile.lock
bundle install
bundle update

start serving with jekyll:
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload

if this fails: (issue with ruby 3 i think
bundle add webrick

bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload

localhost:4000
