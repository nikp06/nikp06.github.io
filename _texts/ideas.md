## todo / ideas
- adding flavours/tags for different categories (ML, Go, Python, Personal)

## here's a list of topics I could potentiall write about, a short description and their proposed chronological order
- Introduction
    - who am I?
    - background (only main points.. elaborated in another blogpost -- how I managed to become a ML Engineer in Germany w/o academic background)
    - what I'm mainly working on atm (ML, Data Engineering, Golang, fun Python side projects when I have time)
- Why this website for and what can you expect?
    - thought repository to document new things that I have learned and found interesting on machine learning, go and python projects and other fun endeavours
    - what I'll upload here therefore will most likely appear unstructured and random (I think I'd like to cover ML stuff, Golang and fun Python projects, and maybe personal only indirectly coding related stuff) -- I just do this for myself, mostly to document knowledge (as I said) and to become better at explaining and communicating technical topics
    - this website is mainly for me but if anyone is helped by something that I have written, then that already means a lot to me
- My personal learning path towards getting the first job as a ML-Engineer (w/o education)
    - courses
    - jobs
    - side-projects
    - covid
